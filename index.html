            <h2 class="section-title">Benefits</h2>
            <p>3D printing reduces costs in medicine by minimizing material waste, lowering production expenses, and making affordable, customized solutions, especially for prosthetics and implants. It accelerates medical processes by enabling rapid prototyping, quicker production times, and efficient pre-surgical planning with patient-specific models and tools. Additionally, it personalizes healthcare by allowing the creation of bespoke prosthetics, patient-specific implants, and tailored bioprinted tissues, improving fit, functionality, and overall patient outcomes.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">Challenges</h2>
            <p>Implementing 3D printing on a broader scale faces technical challenges such as ensuring the precision, durability, and biocompatibility of printed materials. Ethical challenges include concerns about equitable access, patient consent, and the implications of bioprinting human tissues and organs. Regulatory challenges involve establishing comprehensive guidelines for safety, quality control, and approval processes for medical 3D-printed products to ensure they meet stringent health standards.
